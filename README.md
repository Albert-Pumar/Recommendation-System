# Recommendation-System

This is a simple project where three different recommendation systems are created. The first one is the simple recommendation system and it bases recommendations on the most popular items, without taking into account the content viewed by the user. The second one, which is the collaborative recommendation system, bases the recommendations on other users who have had similar evaluations for the items seen by both (user based). Finally, the third recommendation system, the content one, bases the recommendations on the characteristics of the items rated by the user (item-based).

These three recommendation systems allow recommendations for both movies and books. Depending on the user's needs, one dataset or another will be used.

It also allows two initialization methods, manually or using Pickle files. To use this second method, the "pickle_file.py" file must first be executed.

To make the recommendations, or evaluate them, simply run the code "test_esp.py" and follow the instructions that appear on the screen. The content of the files is only available in Spanish.
